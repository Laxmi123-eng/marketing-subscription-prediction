# Marketing Subscription Prediction Model

This project predicts which customers are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing campaign data.  
It demonstrates end-to-end marketing analytics workflow — from data cleaning and model building to threshold optimization and business insight generation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To identify customers who are most likely to subscribe to a marketing offer, helping marketing teams optimize outreach efficiency and campaign ROI.

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. Cleaned and prepared marketing campaign data (`bank.csv`).
2. Built a **Random Forest** model with full preprocessing (OneHotEncoder + StandardScaler).
3. Performed **threshold optimization** to balance recall and precision.
4. Selected an optimal threshold of **0.62**, achieving:
   - Precision: **0.63**
   - Recall: **0.75**
   - F1: **0.68**

## 📊 Key Insights
- Longer call durations strongly correlate with customer conversion.
- Previous successful contacts and account balance are significant predictors.
- Threshold tuning improved efficiency by reducing wasted outreach by ~5%.
